# Docker Compose

<br>

A “docker-compose.yaml” file, is a configuration file that allows us to manage several containers that can communicate with each other. It’s responsible for creating Docker images based on any Dockerfile(s) placed in their respective project folders. This should be in the very root folder. Not root of our project (where source code lives) but at the very root of our Docker working directory.
